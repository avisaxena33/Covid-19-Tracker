# Covid-19 Statistics Dashboard

## Made entirely using React.js, this is my introductory project after learning this awesome front end framework
## Dashboard features (latest)
* Worldwide major Covid-19 statistics on a sidebar updated live
* Cases, recovered, deaths, and many more data points for regions around the world
* Regions include major continents, various countries, US states, and Canadian provinces
* Each region / area (if the data is available) has it's own detail page, which depending on what type of area it is, can be reached using the navbar or clicking on the row of the region in the respective data tables
* On each detail page, right now there is a data table with cumulative statistics of that region alongisde a breakdown of smaller geographical areas that this region encompasses, for example, a detail page of USA will have cumulative USA statistics alongside statistics for each state and so on, each detail page also has a graph of historical data regarding cases, deaths, and recoveries if available
## Inspiration
I'd like to mention that the inspiration for the design came from the https://ncov2019.live/, which in turn I believe got it's design inspiration from https://cov19.cc/. While the designs may be similar, I wanted to differentiate this dashboard by allowing the user to explore Covid-19 data for many more regions, no matter how large or how small as long as the data was available through interactive data tables, which is why you can go from continents -> countries -> states, etc down the chain. I look forward to continuing this chain as I discover more feasible APIs with the data I need. Furthermore, I look forward to implementing features to track vaccine data (if available) and spread more information about Covid in general.
