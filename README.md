# Covid-19 Statistics Dashboard

## Made entirely using React.js, this is my introductory project after learning this awesome front end framework
## Dashboard features (latest)
* Worldwide major Covid-19 statistics on a sidebar updated live
* Cases, recovered, deaths, and many more data points for regions around the world
* Regions include major continents, various countries, US states, and Canadian provinces
* Each region / area (if the data is available) has it's own detail page, which depending on what type of area it is, can be reached using the navbar or clicking on the row of the region in the respective data tables
* On each detail page, right now there is a data table with cumulative statistics of that region alongisde a breakdown of smaller geographical areas that this region encompasses, for example, a detail page of USA will have cumulative USA statistics alongside statistics for each state and so on, each detail page also has a graph of historical data regarding cases, deaths, and recoveries if available
